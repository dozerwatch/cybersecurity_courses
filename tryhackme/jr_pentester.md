## Principles of Security
- **CIA**
    - Confidentiality
        - Protection of data from unauthorized access
    - Integrity
        - Ensure information is unchanged
    - Availability
        - Data is available and accessible for user
- **Principles of Privilege**
    - Users should be given the minimum amount of privileges.
    - The levels of access given to individuals are determined on two primary factors:
        1. The individual's role/function within the organisation
        2. The sensitivity of the information being stored on the system
    - Two key concepts are used to assign and manage the access rights of individuals
        1. Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
        2. Privileged Access Management (PAM)
- **Security Models Continued**
    - Any system storing information is called an information system.
    - The Bell-La Padula Model
        - Used to achieve confidentiality
        - "no write down, no read up"
        - used in government and military
        - heavily relies on trust within organization
    - The Biba Model
        - Used to achieve integrity
        - "no write up, no read down"
        - used in software development
- **Threat Modelling & Incident Response**
    - Threat modelling is the process of reviewing, improving, and testing the security protocols in place in an organisation's information technology infrastructure and services.
    - A breach of security is known as an incident.
    - Actions taken to resolve and remediate the threat are known as Incident Response. 
    - Incidents are classified using a rating of urgency and impact. 
        - Urgency will be determined by the type of attack faced.
        - Impact will be determined by the affected system and what impact that has on business operations.
