## Principles of Security
- **CIA**
    - Confidentiality
        - Protection of data from unauthorized access
    - Integrity
        - Ensure information is unchanged
    - Availability
        - Data is available and accessible for user
- **Principles of Privilege**
    - Users should be given the minimum amount of privileges.
    - The levels of access given to individuals are determined on two primary factors:
        1. The individual's role/function within the organization
        2. The sensitivity of the information being stored on the system
    - Two key concepts are used to assign and manage the access rights of individuals
        1. Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
        2. Privileged Access Management (PAM)
- **Security Models Continued**
    - Any system storing information is called an information system.
    - The Bell-La Padula Model
        - Used to achieve confidentiality
        - "no write down, no read up"
        - used in government and military
        - heavily relies on trust within organization
    - The Biba Model
        - Used to achieve integrity
        - "no write up, no read down"
        - used in software development
- **Threat Modelling & Incident Response**
    - Threat modelling is the process of reviewing, improving, and testing the security protocols in place in an organization's information technology infrastructure and services.
    - A breach of security is known as an incident.
    - Actions taken to resolve and remediate the threat are known as Incident Response. 
    - Incidents are classified using a rating of urgency and impact. 
        - Urgency will be determined by the type of attack faced.
        - Impact will be determined by the affected system and what impact that has on business operations.

## Walking an Application
- Learn how to manually review a web application for security issues using browser builtin tools.
- Page Source
    - Comments
    - Links
    - Directories
    - Not up-to-date framework
- Frameworks are a collection of pre-made code that help a developer include common features a website needs.
- Developer Tools
    - Inspector
        - Live view
        - Interact with page elements
    - Debugger/Sources
        - Used to debug JavaScript
        - `{}` beautifies
    - Network
        - Tracks every external requests a webpage makes

## Content Discovery
- What is content?
    - A file, video, picture, backup, feature, etc.
- Content discovery is finding content not meant for public access.
- There are three ways to discover content:
    1. Manual
        1. robots.txt
            - A file telling search engines which pages they can or can't show in their results
        2. Favicon
            - A small icon on the tab for branding a website
            - Can give away the framework used
        3. sitemap.xml
            - Lists files to be listed on search engines
        4. HTTP headers
            - Server
            - X-Powered-By
        5. Framework Stack
            - Explore framework site for vulnerabilities
    2. OSINT
        1. Google hacking / Dorking
            - Utilize Google's advanced search engine features to pick out custom content
        2. Wappalyzer
            - Online tool and browser extension that helps identify what technologies a website uses
        3. Wayback Machine
            - Historical archive of websites
        4. Github
        5. S3 Buckets
            - Ends in .s3.amazonaws.com
            - Storage server by Amazon AWS
            - Owner of files can make files public or private or writable
    3. Automatic
        - Use tools to discover content: `ffuf`, `dirb`, `gobuster`
