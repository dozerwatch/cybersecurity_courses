## Pentesting Fundamentals
- A **pentration test** or **pentest** is an ethical and legal attack on an application to test and analyze its security defences.
- *What makes a pentest legal?*
    - The system owner and pentester form an agreement on the tools and techniques used and allowed systems to be tested on before the pentest begins.
    - The **Rules of Engagement** is a document that decides how the pentest will be carried out. It consists of 3 main sections: 
        | Section | Description 
        | ------- | ----------- 
        | Permission | Give legal permission for pentest
        | Test Scope | Define the systems to be tested on
        | Rules | Define the allowed techniques
- The steps a pentester takes is called the **methodology**. All methodology follow this general theme:
    | Stage | Description
    | ----- | -----------
    | Information Gathering | Collect publicly accessible information about target(s)
    | Enumeration | Discover services running on target
    | Exploitation | Use vulnerabilities discovered on services
    | Privilege Escalation | Expand your access on target
    | Post-exploitation | Attack other targets, find more information about current target, cover tracks, reporting
- There are 3 primary scopes when pentesting:
    | Box   | Description |
