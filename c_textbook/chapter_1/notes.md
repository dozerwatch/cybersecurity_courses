# Chapter 1

## 1.1 Getting Started

The type specifier for `main()` can be missing and the program can still be compiled.

What is the difference between `cc` and `gcc`?

A C program conists of *functions* and *variables*. Programs begin executing at the beginning of the `main` function.

`#include <stdio.h>`  tells the compiler to include information about the standard input/output library.

A *character string* or *string constant* is a sequence of characters in double quotes.

An *escape sequence* like `\n` provides a way to represent hard-to-type or invisible characters.

## 1.2 Variables and Arithmetic Expressions

In C, all variables must be declared before they are used.

The body of a `while` can be one or more statements enclosed in braces, or a single statement without braces.

In C, **integer division** truncates: any fractional part is discarded! Thus, it is not very accurate.

`printf` is a general-purpose output formatting function. It is not a part of the C language, but from the standard library of functions. C, itself, has no input or output defined.

If an arithmetic operator has one floating-point operand and one integer operand, the integer will be converted to floating point before the operation is done.
